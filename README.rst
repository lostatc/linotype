    An example of terminal output generated by linotype.

**linotype** is a python library for generating help messages for your program that
are formatted automatically. Messages are defined in the code using a simple
interface and can be printed to the terminal and/or imported into your
**Sphinx** documentation, which removes the need for duplicate documentation.
Line wrapping, indentation, alignment and markup are all applied automatically,
making your help message easier to maintain so that you can focus on the
content.

This program focuses on providing more options for configuring your help
message than **argparse** in the Python standard library. It gives you full
control over the structure and formatting and allows you to do many things that
are impossible with **argparse** alone. See the full documentation below for
more details.
